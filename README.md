# Socket-Programming-with-C
Simple programs containing Socket Programming with C

1. A Simple TCP Client program that takes the hostname/IP of the server and port number of the Server as Command Line arguments
and is able to send messages to that server and receive the response from the server back.
2. A Simple TCP Single-Client Server program that takes the port number as command-line argument and can listen and accept a client
connection and interact with the client till it says "Bye" just like a simple chat application.
3. A Multi-client Echo Server using fork() that sends the same response back to client that client sent. 
4. A raw socket implementation of ICMP echo ping programme that fills all the headers starting from Ethernet header to ICMP header with payload (Complete packet implementation from Scratch).
